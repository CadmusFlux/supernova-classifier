## CNN Model

We have given 3 files:

1. The iPython/Jupyter notebook file (`type-Ia-supernova-classifier-cnn.ipynb`)
2. The .py file outputted from iPython/Jupyter (`type-Ia-supernova-classifier-cnn.py`)
3. Functions that are used in the other 2 files (`space_utils.py`)

For this specific model, we strongly recommend the iPython/Jupyter notebook file. The code
explanation is a lot nicer in the notebook interface, it will be easier to learn what is going on!

There are 2 main data files that are used in the code:

1. all_object_data_in_dictionary_format.pkl
2. normalized_image_object_data_in_numpy_format.pkl

The descriptions for what each one does it in the code.

However, there are 3 different sizes of each with the links below:
