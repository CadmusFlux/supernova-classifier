## space2vec: Model Code

Detection of supernovae for astronomers is a task where machine learning can help reduce time resources, while increasing accuracy. In this project we build a supernova classification system to allow detection of images from the Dark Energy Survey using a ConvNet model.

The project behind the code is talked about in detail throughout the blog posts. But this
is where the cool code stuff happens!

You can find the model in the `/cnn-model` directory where you can find all model code and links to data.

## Environment
We have supplied requirements.txt file which you can use to setup the right environment. This was made for Python 3.6, 
so if you are getting errors about missing versions or something similar try removing anything after the "==" for that
library in the requirements.txt and run again.
